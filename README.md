# SimpleTKinterApp

This is a simple desktop application built in Python, utilizing Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Requests for API communication. It is designed for managing waste transfer cards in the BDO system using API keys. The application operates in the test environment: BDO Test Environment. This is a test project, not a fully functional application. Its primary purpose is to practice working with APIs and creating graphical interfaces in Python.

The project requires Python 3.10+ and the libraries listed in requirements.txt. Some libraries in requirements.txt may not be essential for the application's functionality, as the file was generated automatically from the development environment.

To install and run the application, first, clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/JestemMatus/SimpleTKinterApp. It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment before installing dependencies. Then, install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.

To launch the application, run the script KpoMainWindow.py using the command python KpoMainWindow.py. Once the application starts, enter the required API keys for authentication and use the available GUI functions to manage waste transfer cards in the BDO system.

If you encounter login or authentication problems, restart the application and try again, verify the correctness of the API keys, and ensure that you are using the correct BDO test environment.

This project is for educational purposes only and is not intended for production use.
